# ios-ituneslist-codingchallenge
This is an iOS app which I made for the coding challenge in a company I applied.


**Basic Description:**
It is an iOS app that pulls data from iTunes Store API server. It shows a list of movies and tracks on iTunes.
It displays a simple master-detail using tableView. If the user taps on one of the lists, the app shows a Detail View
which gives more information.


**Architecture used:**
I used the MVC architecture because it most common design pattern on iOS since they have started and also it is easiest to implement.


**Frameworks used:**
I used SDWebImage for downloading the image data easily.
